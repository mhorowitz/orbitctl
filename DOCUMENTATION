This is just a listing of references I found which were helpful in
understanding what is going on with the Orbit AF.

https://github.com/libuvc/libuvc/blob/master/cameras/quickcampro9000.txt

  includes extension units for the same extensions as the Orbit, but
  using CS_INTERFACE descriptor type instead of the Logitech vendor one.

  This explains and points to documentation of the format of a vendor
  specific descriptor type.

  Hey. Microsoft controllers use vendor descriptor types, too.

  I'm skeptical of the 1/64th degree absolute pan/tilt existing on the
  Orbit AF.  Reset seems right, though.

  A real lsusb for Mac, based on the linux one.  Fully decodes
  descriptors, but doesn't know about the vendor-specific types (just
  prints UNRECOGNIZED, but at least dumps the raw bytes).

  A cli tool for manipulating UVC devices on Mac.  It compiles and works, but it's not really
  built to be easily extensible in the ways I need.

  A tool which claims to support pan/tilt.  But it's a decade old, and
  I couldn't get it to build on my Mac.

  The original upstream for the above.  I don't think it does pan/tilt, though.
